The app we’ve built primarily tackles the issues faced in the healthcare sector.

The healthcare sector is one of the most overlooked sectors especially in developing countries. In the current day and age, everything is being digitized. The healthcare sector is also being digitized, but this is mostly internal and not for the end user. 

Medications still have to be bought manually, prescriptions and reports are still on paper, there’s no structured method to look for blood donors. There’s apps to order food from your phone, but the same isn’t available for medicines.There have been apps made in the past that have made some things easier for the consumer. 

The problem is that there is no streamlined experience for users. There’s no single place the user can go to to deal with all things health care and also have a great user experience. This is what we’re trying to solve.

We’ve built an android application which we believe tackles some of these important but often currently overlooked issues and makes a better overall experience for the end user. The app completely follows material-design guidelines. It has a simple tabbed UI which is intuitive, functional, yet simple to use. Even by senior citizens.

The app also has an user-friendly introduction for first-timers that briefs on the capabilities of the app.
